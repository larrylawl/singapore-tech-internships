# Singapore Tech Internships!

All positions are Software Engineering roles, unless otherwise specified in the Notes column. Similarly, all positions are open to anyone enrolled in a Bachelor's degree program, unless specific graduation years are mentioned in the Notes column. Internships here are for mostly for **Summer 2020.**

**Note**: Some companies do not have a website dedicated for recruitment or internship applications. Some others do not have an internship position listed on their recruitment page although they do accept interns. In these cases, even though the company is listed below, they might not link to a application page.
